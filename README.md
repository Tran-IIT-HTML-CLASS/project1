# project1

This is a project where I make a form with user design in mind. In this first iteration, I have laid out the framework for what I intend the form to look like and the fields that should be filled in. The next iteration with revisions will incorporate a time-slot feature for the date and time fieldset, as well as two pictures (logos or stock book photos) on each side of the title to add flair.

In doing this project, I hope to learn:
* Good Design Practices
* HTML Form Elements and CSS Form Stylizing Elements
* Iterative Design; i.e. Making small changes to my code at a time
